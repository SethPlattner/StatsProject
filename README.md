# StatsProject
a scouting stats project 
to get the program to run download the JDK from https://openjdk.org/
then download and install VS code 
then get the gradle extension
then just copy in the code and run and it should work
note- it will not work on school computers because gradle tries to run through command.exe which is blocked
